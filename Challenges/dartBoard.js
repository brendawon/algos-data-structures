//calculate the score on a dart board
//20 number values on the dart board
//bull's eye, bull, double inner circle, double outer circle, triple inner circle, triple outer circle
//use of pythagorean theorem - hypotenuse = radius (dart's location)
//use of atan2(y,x) to find the radian, use of radian to degrees
//find degree boundaries for number value scores
