# Frequency counters
- Use objects to count how often something occurs
- Increment or decrement
Ex. sameFrequency - given two positive integers, find out if two numbers have the same frequency of digits
Ex. Anagrams - given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first

# Pointers
- Create pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Two pointers: typically uses while (left < right) as a stopping condition, which indicates when there is an overlap of the poiners 
Ex. sumZero - given a sorted array of integers, find the first pair where the sum is zero
- Multiple pointers: 
Ex. countUniqueValues - given a sorted array, count the unique values in the array

# Sliding Window
- Create a window which can be  either an array or number from one position to another to keep track of a subset
- The window either increases or closes depending on a certain condition
Ex. maxSubarraySum - given an array of integers and a number n, calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive elements in the array

# Divide and Conquer
- Divide a data set into smaller chunks and repeat the process with a subset of data
Ex. binary search (check from the middle, if the target is greater or less, go to either the left or right of the middle and find that middle value; repeat)
