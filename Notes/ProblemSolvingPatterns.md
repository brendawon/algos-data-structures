# Frequency counters
- Use objects to count how often something occurs
- Increment or decrement
Ex. Anagrams - given two strings, write a function to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first

# Pointers
- Create pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end or middle based on a certain condition
- Two pointers: typically uses while (left < right) as a stopping condition, which indicates when there is an overlap of the poiners 
Ex. sumZero - given a sorted array of integers, find the first pair where the sum is zero
- Multiple pointers: 
Ex. countUniqueValues - given a sorted array, count the unique values in the array
