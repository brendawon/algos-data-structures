# Searching

## Linear Search - searches for items one at a time
- Built in JavaScript searches: indexOf, includes, find, findIndex
- Big O = O(n) where n is the size of the array

## Binary Search - you can eliminate half of the items at a time
- Only works on sorted array
- Big O = O(log n) because you eliminate half the array at each search

## Naive String Search - searches for substrings in a string
