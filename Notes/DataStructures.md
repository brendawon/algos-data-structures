# Data Structures

## Singly Linked Lists - head, tail, length properties; each list consists of nodes and has a value and pointer to another node or null (marks the end)

- Singly Linked Lists have nodes in which each node only points to one other node
- Do not have indices
- Nodes are connected with a next pointer
- Cannot randomly access a node

## Doubly Linked Lists

- Linked List that has nodes in which each node can point to multiple nodes
