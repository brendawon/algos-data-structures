Rules of Thumb
1. Arithmetic operations are constants = O(1)
2. Variable assignment is constant = O(1)
3. Accessing elements in an array (by index) or object (by key) is constant = O(1)
4. In a loop, the time complexity is the length of the loop times the complexity of whatever happens inside of the loop
